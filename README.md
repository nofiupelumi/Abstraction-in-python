Abstraction in Python Examples
These examples demonstrate the concept of abstraction in Python using object-oriented programming. Abstraction is a fundamental principle that allows you to hide the implementation details and focus on the essential attributes and behaviors of objects. It helps to manage complexity and promote code reusability.

Example 1: Abstraction using Classes and Methods
Purpose:
The first example showcases abstraction using abstract base classes and concrete subclasses representing different geometric shapes. It provides a common interface to calculate the area of various shapes while encapsulating the specific calculations for each shape.

How to Use:
Run the Python script.

Create instances of the Circle and Rectangle classes, passing the required parameters (e.g., radius for a circle or length and width for a rectangle).

Call the area() method on each shape instance to calculate and print the area.

Example 2: Abstraction with a Vehicle Class
Purpose:
The second example demonstrates abstraction with a base class Vehicle and concrete subclasses Car and Boat. It abstracts the behavior of starting the engine, allowing you to work with different types of vehicles through a common interface.

How to Use:
Run the Python script.

Create instances of the Car and Boat classes, providing the make and model of each vehicle.

Call the start_engine() method on each vehicle instance to simulate starting the engine and print the output.

These examples illustrate the power of abstraction in Python by providing a structured way to work with various objects while hiding their underlying complexities. Abstraction helps improve code organization and maintainability, making it easier to manage and extend your projects.
